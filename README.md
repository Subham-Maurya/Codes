# SPOJ Solutions

Welcome to the SPOJ Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)](https://www.spoj.com/), a platform for competitive programming and problem-solving.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to share my own solutions to various SPOJ problems. By sharing these solutions, I hope to contribute helpful resources and showcase my problem-solving skills.

## Statement of Authenticity

All solutions in this repository are my own work. I have solved each problem independently, by using some online resources like gfg, CF blogs, DMOJ etc. The code and explanations presented here are based on my understanding and efforts.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Browsing Solutions**: You can browse the problem just by using the name of the file.

## Disclaimer

While I share my solutions to promote learning, I encourage you to solve problems on your own before referring to these solutions. Spoilers can diminish the learning experience, and solving problems independently is essential for growth as a programmer.
